				<h2>Other Professional and Technical Experience</h2>
				<ul id="other-prof-tech-experience-list">
					<li>
						For one of my classes at Clover Park Technical College, assisted in designing and implementing a
						medium-sized, multi-branch enterprise network using both open source and proprietary operating
						systems and applications. This project included four seperate teams, all of whom had their own
						network to set up, and once each network was completely set up, we then began the process of
						connecting them as though they were different branch offices of the same company.
					</li>
					<li>
						Coordinated between an Aerospace Composites class and a Game Design class to plan and
						construct a table top, multiplayer, arcade-style game cabinet at the Pierce County Skills Center with
						the goal of teaching us students how to work with other “departments” and complete a task in a timely
						manner. Our class produced the computer components, the Aerospace Composites class created the
						housing, and the Game Design class developed the game.
					</li>
					<li>
						On two separate occasions, removed old network cabling and installed new network cabling for our
						classoom at the Pierce County Skills Center, which required removing the raised floor that we had in
						the classroom, tearing out the old cabling, and running new cabling. We did this to change the layout
						of the classroom, as the desks got their network connections from boxes contained in floor tiles which
						could be moved to different locations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Acted as a Clover Park Technical College liaison during a career conference for high school students.
						Cordinated with the program instructor and her classroom of 30 students to construct exhibits
						displaying the program’s content. I improved the program’s efficiency in preparing for the rush of
						highschool students that attended the event. As a result, the displays were set up on schedule and
						saftey preparations and security measures were in place, leading to a safe and successful career
						conference.
